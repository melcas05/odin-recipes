        A cupcake (AmE, CanE), fairy cake (BrE), or bun (IrE) is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup. As with larger cakes, frosting, icing and various other cake decorations such as fruit and candy may be applied.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            ¾ cup superfine sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            ⅔ cup butter, softened
        </li>
        <li>
            3 large eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            1 ½ cups self-rising flour
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
        </li>
     
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
          <li>
            Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Beat in vanilla extract. Stir in flour just until mixed; spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
          </li>

        </ol>
